My childhood dream was a combination of occupations. As a child, I wanted to be a carpenter, then that carpenter changed to being an interior designer. Designer turned to a chef then turned to a programmer. I was exposed to computer in such a young age, around 5 years old. I saw my daddy playing first person shooter games which interested me in those kind of action games. Over the course of my childhood, it just developed as I stay in an internet cafe owned by my aunt which led me to strengthen my pursuit of being a programmer.
